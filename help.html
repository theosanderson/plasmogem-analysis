The <a href="http://plasmogem.sanger.ac.uk">PlasmoGEM project</a> produces high-efficiency vectors for the genetic manipulation of malaria parasites. The project has also developed barcode-sequencing approaches to phenotype parasites generated by these vectors at scale (described in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732065">Gomes et al., 2015</a>). These approaches have now provided data on the relative growth rates of asexual blood stages for more than 2,500 <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> genes. This data, yet to be published, is presented on this website.

<h3>Data currently available</h3>
At present this database contains relative growth rates of determined for asexual blood-stages of gene knock-out mutants in female Balb/c  mice. A relative growth rate of 1 reflects the removal of a dispensable gene with no consequence to the parasite under the conditions of the experiment. Growth rate values lower than 1 reflect attenuation of asexual blood-stage growth. 

<h3>A living dataset</h3>
This is an early data release and the experiments, and algorithms, for calculating fitness continue to evolve. The fitness values and phenotypes shown here will change in later releases.


<h3>Using the interface</h3>
<h4>The main graph / table</h4>
<p>The fundamental value which this dataset reports is an inferred <i>relative growth rate</i> for the mutant, which is given with a confidence interval reflecting how accurately our algorithm believes it has measured it. The main graph reflects this. The x-axis represents <i>Relative growth rate</i>, with genes likely to be essential on the left hand side and those likely to be redundant, or to accelerate asexual blood stage growth (AP2-G) shown on the right hand-side. The y-axis represents <i>Confidence</i>. Those towards the top we believe we have measured most accurately. At the very bottom of the graph there is <i>total uncertainty</i> about the growth rate.  </p>
<p>You can zoom in on the plot by drawing a box with your mouse, and double clicking on it.</p>
<p>You can also click on the <strong>Table</strong> tab to view the data in tabular format.</p>
<h4>Searching</h4>
<p>The tabs below the main graph/table allow you to search either by gene ID (can be both the current generation or previous generation of PBANKA IDs) or by a general text search. These searches will filter both the graph and the table.</p>
<h4>More information</h4>
To gain more information on a gene, please <strong>click on one of the points</strong>. The gene name, and product description, will be shown. A plot will also illustrate our estimate of the uncertainty in the result. Clicking on <i>More diagnostic info</i>  will reveal the raw barcode-counts that went into calculating the growth rate.
<h4>What do the phenotypes mean?</h4>

To make then numerical values of fitness more digestible we also provide textual descriptions of phenotype. At the moment there are five of these:
<table class="helptable">
	<tr>
		<td>Insufficient data</td><td>This means that so few of the barcode for this mutant were observed in the experiment that we cannot call a fitness for the mutant. These genes may be essential, but may sometimes reflect technical failures.</td>	</tr>
		<tr>	<td>Likely essential</td></td><td>In these case we observed barcodes falling in abundance and calculated a fitness value that statistically could be the same as that for an essential gene (0-0.1). </td>	</tr>
		<tr>	<td>Significantly slow</td></td><td>This means that we observed barcodes falling in abundance and calculated a fitness value that is significantly different both from the gene being redundant, and from it being essential</td>	</tr>
		<tr>	<td>Likely dispensable</td></td><td>In these cases we observed barcode abundance consistent with the gene being dispensable in the blood-stages.</td>	</tr>
			<tr>	<td>Significantly fast</td></td><td>In these few cases we observed barcode abundance increasing significantly faster than would be expected for a redundant gene knock-out, suggesting accelerated growth in the blood stage.</td>	</tr>

<h2>Further information / FAQs</h2>
<!--<h3>How accurate is the data?</h3>
<p>No high-throughput screening method is perfect, and our algorithms for processing barcode-sequencing data continue to evolve. However the biological relevance of the data generated so far places some confidence in the data. For instance a search for "ribosomal" will find that 95% of called phenotypes are "Likely essential", whereas a search for "ookinete" returns no likely essential genes. In addition the most confidently called "Significantly fast" gene is AP2-G which has a well-known growth advantage in the blood stage. </p>

<h3>How is the fitness value calculated?</h3>
<p>This procedure is rather complicated. In brief, the rate at which barcode abdundance changes from one day to the next during an infection is taken as a relative measure of how fast each mutant grows. These values are normalised to a number of control mutants, included in every experiment, and a weighted average is taken which preferentially uses the values predicted to be the most accurate. A more detailed explanation will be available in the near future, but in the mean time you are welcome to <a href="mailto:ts10@sanger.ac.uk">contact us</a> with queries.</p>-->
